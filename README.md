# OyincodeToken

### My ERC20 token deployed to the Rinkeby Test Network, see link here: 
https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xfb2ceaf49c1e005e58a1b5761e35c91c8cbaf1764923e1dc7cbdb7f339ae7ba4

### What ERC20 tokens are required to do:

- Get the total token supply.
- Get the account balance.
- Transfer the token from one party to another.
- Approve the use of token as a monetary asset.

## Added the SafeMath Library to prevent integer overflow attack
